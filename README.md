To run this game from the source code, you must have the java JDK installed
You can get download and install the java JDK from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html 

You must also add the jdk to your ENVIRONMENT path, enabling you to execute the command "javac" from the command line.

Please send me an email if you need help doing any of this.  I will occasionally compile the code myself and post executables so you don't have to
